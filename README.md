# Serene

The kernel for Serene (yes I know it's all called serene I'm fucking terrible at naming), supporting mainly x86_64 but *hopefully* other architectures in the future.

## Overview

It's a microkernel in c. go fish.

## Features

- **Should be portable enough**: Hopefully
- **It has some security**: Yeah sure
- **IPC system**: It does the bare minimum
- **Memory management**: again, bare minimum
- **Scheduling**: This one works ok I guess
- **ACPI support**: Yeah it has that too

## Building

The kernel is built as part of the [system distribution](https://github.com/serenekernel/serene-dist)
